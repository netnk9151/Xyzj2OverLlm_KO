    translated: "The founder of the Primordial Origin Sword School, Zhang Siguo, was once a disciple of the Xuanmen immortal master Bai Wenching. After Bai Wenching's passing, Zhang Siguo established the Primordial Origin Sword School. Due to his protection of many civilians affected by war, he gained numerous disciples within the Yan Kingdom, making it one of the earliest schools to emerge there. He witnessed the unification among the seven states and the prosperity of Qi, Yan, and Chu. Later, as Emperor Jiahe revered Xuanmen, many disciples from the Primordial Origin Sword School were able to navigate among nobles and aristocrats, even participating in some noble conflicts. Similarly, numerous families sent their children to the Primordial Origin Sword School for training, gradually establishing it as the foremost school within Xuanmen."

    translated: "Later, Duan Chengjun believed that if everyone became obsessed with Xuanmen and no one produced goods, it would lead to a national disaster. Consequently, he decided on reforming the system. Many Xuanmen sects suffered greatly during this time, but the impact was most severe for the Danding lineage. However, the Primordial Origin Sword Sect managed to quickly adapt to the reforms and continue its glory due to its deep roots and greater emphasis on mastering swordsmanship and Heart Methods, along with timely adjustments in the sect's management approach."

The Primordial Origin Sword Sect assessed the situation and decided to support Prince Liang, enhancing his power so that he could gain influence within the imperial family. Meanwhile, Prince Liang held the Primordial Origin Sword Sect in high regard, ensuring that even after a thousand years, it remained at the forefront of Xuanmen."
