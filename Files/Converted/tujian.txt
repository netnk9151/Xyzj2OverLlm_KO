    translated: "The founder of the Primordial Origin Sword School, Zhang Siguo, was once a disciple of the Xuanmen immortal master Bai Wenching. After Bai Wenching's passing, Zhang Siguo established the Primordial Origin Sword School. Due to his protection of many civilians affected by war, he gained numerous disciples within the Yan Kingdom, making it one of the earliest schools to emerge there. He witnessed the unification among the seven states and the prosperity of Qi, Yan, and Chu. Later, as Emperor Jiahe revered Xuanmen, many disciples from the Primordial Origin Sword School were able to navigate among nobles and aristocrats, even participating in some noble conflicts. Similarly, numerous families sent their children to the Primordial Origin Sword School for training, gradually establishing it as the foremost school within Xuanmen."

    translated: "Later, Duan Chengjun believed that if everyone became obsessed with Xuanmen and no one produced goods, it would lead to a national disaster. Consequently, he decided on reforming the system. Many Xuanmen sects suffered greatly during this time, but the impact was most severe for the Danding lineage. However, the Primordial Origin Sword Sect managed to quickly adapt to the reforms and continue its glory due to its deep roots and greater emphasis on mastering swordsmanship and Heart Methods, along with timely adjustments in the sect's management approach."

    translated: "Three hundred years later, after Chapter Wu Emperor's plot to rebel failed and he was imprisoned, the vassal kings of Yan Kingdom were plunged into chaos. After assessing the situation, the Primordial Origin Sword Sect chose to support King Liang, enabling his power to grow stronger and secure a voice within the imperial court. Meanwhile, King Liang held great regard for the Primordial Origin Sword Sect, allowing it to remain as the leader among the Xuanmen after surviving through countless generations."

    translated: "Although the Sect Leader often travels or meditates in seclusion due to his dedication to swordsmanship, and thus does not frequently manage sect affairs, his reputation in Jianghu is notable. This is because Season Liang frequently engages in sparring with others and possesses exceptional sword artistry. Many people seek out Season Liang daily for instruction. Furthermore, numerous individuals admire his formidable reputation and enter the Primordial Origin Sword Sect to dedicate themselves to learning."
