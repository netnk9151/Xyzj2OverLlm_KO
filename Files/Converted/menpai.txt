Dugu Zhan, amidst this chaotic world, founded Tianji Ge to carve out a niche for himself by collecting intelligence from various nations and sects. This allowed him to establish his own power base during the chaos. After several hundred years of refinement, the Three States' standoff came into being, and Tianji Ge became the largest Jianghu Sect and the greatest gathering place of information in all under heaven. Consequently, all three states—Xia, Jin, and Zhou—sought to bring Tianji Ge under their control. At a time when everyone was curious about which power Tianji Ge would ultimately support, news broke that Tianji Ge had moved its base to the upper reaches of the Great River, declaring independence from the Three States and all sects, and renamed itself as the Evernight Capital due to its independence from the Three States."

    translated: "The Imperial Void Gate was established during the most chaotic period of the Seven Kingdoms. It offered protection based on surname affiliation and gained its earliest disciples this way, becoming one of the most important sects in the Xuanmen. The Imperial Void Gate advocates for removing worldly distractions and practicing meditation with a tranquil mind, achieving notable accomplishments in alchemical cauldron lineage. During Emperor Jiahe's reign over the Yan Kingdom, he greatly admired the Imperial Void Gate's alchemical techniques, allowing many of its disciples to enter the palace and practice alchemy for him. At that time, the Imperial Void Gate was renowned as the leading sect in the Xuanmen. However, after Duke Deng Chengjun's reforms, many disciples of the Imperial Void Gate were imprisoned on charges of betraying their country and deceiving the emperor. A significant number of texts they authored or compiled were sealed away, resulting in severe losses, and the former glory of the sect was never restored."

About three hundred years ago, due to many laypeople becoming monks to avoid being plundered by bandits, blacksmith Sun Ju created numerous mechanisms and weapons for defense and gathered local ordinary citizens under his protection. Gradually, Sun Ju established his own faction and founded the Ink Gate Sect. After establishing the sect, he began to compile various texts and sought theoretical support for his style. Subsequently, with theories such as benevolence without aggression and valuing the virtuous while being frugal, he emphasized the common people and wielded strong influence among them."

The ancestor, Du Chengjun, once assisted the young emperor of the Yan Kingdom in suppressing rebellious princes and stabilizing the situation. He also secured the hidden treasures of Emperor Jiahe and established a series of rules for the development of Xuanmen arts. This prevented the Yan Kingdom from descending into chaos where everyone was absorbed in cultivation with no one left to produce goods. Following this, the Segeng family was held in high regard by the kings and became one of the largest families in the Yan Kingdom. However, as the Yan Kingdom developed, the power of its kings also grew stronger, diminishing their reliance on the Segeng family's influence. As a result, the Segeng family's power was gradually weakened. Nevertheless, the children of the Segeng family continued to adhere strictly to their household rules and serve their sovereigns without overstepping their bounds."

    translated: "After Emperor Zhang Wu was imprisoned, several vassal kings began to vie for power among themselves, leading to continuous disputes and annexations of each other's territories. To pacify the people, Prince Liang did not completely exterminate some common soldiers from the conquered regions; instead, those who still wished to protect their country and people were re-enlisted. The rest were allowed to return to their rural homes. Under these circumstances, the Hong Yue Gang was established by a group of warriors whose families had been lost but who no longer wanted to be drawn into endless battles in their fiefdoms. They formed their own gang, mingled among the Jianghu, and struggled to make ends meet. Occasionally, they would rob passing wealthy merchants to aid the impoverished locals nearby."

    translated: "Hidden Peach Village is nestled amidst winding hills and valleys, resembling an earthly paradise. It is a secluded corner of the world where human life has been forgotten. Alongside the village runs a stream beside an ancient well, with clear water gently flowing past; terraced rice fields emit fragrant aromas as wisps of cooking smoke rise into the air. The four seasons are distinct: peach blossoms and spring waters, summer cicadas, autumn harvests, and winter snow—all untouched by worldly dust or desires for fame and profit. Simple life is cherished here, with peaceful years passing slowly. In this place, one waits until clouds part to see the moonlight clearly. The scenery here surpasses that of the mundane world."

    translated: "Greedy Wolf Path, connecting the inner and outer gates through hidden routes; in the thousand mountains under the dusk snow, a solitary moon casts its cold light upon ancient trails. A wolf's shadow circles by the path; with the wind's whistle and ghostly howls chill the air. The greedy wolf yowls at night—heroes dare not ask their way home. Beyond the outer gate lies the vast desert with straight lines of smoke, while within the inner gates, mountains and rivers abound in beauty. A path marked by the Greedy Wolf; a sword points to distant shores where the road is never lost."

    translated: "The stream flows clear and refreshing, winding through rocks and forests with a gentle murmur; tall pines and lush bamboo shield this tranquil corner of the world. As one crosses stones to ford the stream, light mist drifts on the surface while the initial calls of deer resonate softly. In seeking out hidden beauties, the soul finds purification, shedding worldly dust. At the foot of Chongwu Valley, travelers are often seen leaning on railings and singing; this valley is not only famed for its clear waters and picturesque landscapes but also possesses a spiritual energy that attracts practitioners to meditate here, gaining insight into the ultimate truths of heaven and earth."
