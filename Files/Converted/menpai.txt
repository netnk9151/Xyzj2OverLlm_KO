Dugu Zhan, amidst this chaotic world, founded Tianji Ge to carve out a niche for himself by collecting intelligence from various nations and sects. This allowed him to establish his own power base during the chaos. After several hundred years of refinement, the Three States' standoff came into being, and Tianji Ge became the largest Jianghu Sect and the greatest gathering place of information in all under heaven. Consequently, all three states‑Xia, Jin, and Zhou‑sought to bring Tianji Ge under their control. At a time when everyone was curious about which power Tianji Ge would ultimately support, news broke that Tianji Ge had moved its base to the upper reaches of the Great River, declaring independence from the Three States and all sects, and renamed itself as the Evernight Capital due to its independence from the Three States."

It offered protection based on surname affiliation and gained its earliest disciples this way, becoming one of the most important sects in the Xuanmen. The Imperial Void Gate advocates for removing worldly distractions and practicing meditation with a tranquil mind, achieving notable accomplishments in alchemical cauldron lineage. During Emperor Jiahe's reign over the Yan Kingdom, he greatly admired the Imperial Void Gate's alchemical techniques, allowing many of its disciples to enter the palace and practice alchemy for him. At that time, the Imperial Void Gate was renowned as the leading sect in the Xuanmen. However, after Duke Deng Chengjun's reforms, many disciples of the Imperial Void Gate were imprisoned on charges of betraying their country and deceiving the emperor. A significant number of texts they authored or compiled were sealed away, resulting in severe losses, and the former glory of the sect was never restored."

The ancestor, Du Chengjun, once assisted the young emperor of the Yan Kingdom in suppressing rebellious princes and stabilizing the situation. He also secured the hidden treasures of Emperor Jiahe and established a series of rules for the development of Xuanmen arts. This prevented the Yan Kingdom from descending into chaos where everyone was absorbed in cultivation with no one left to produce goods. Following this, the Segeng family was held in high regard by the kings and became one of the largest families in the Yan Kingdom. However, as the Yan Kingdom developed, the power of its kings also grew stronger, diminishing their reliance on the Segeng family's influence. As a result, the Segeng family's power was gradually weakened. Nevertheless, the children of the Segeng family continued to adhere strictly to their household rules and serve their sovereigns without overstepping their bounds."

    translated: "After Emperor Zhangwu was imprisoned, several vassal kings began to vie for power among themselves, leading to ongoing disputes and the annexation of one fiefdom by another. In an effort to soothe public sentiment, Prince Liang did not completely eliminate ordinary soldiers from the annexed fiefdoms; those who survived were given a choice. If they still wished to protect their country and people, they could be re‑enlisted. Those who did not would be allowed to return to their villages. The Grand Moon Gang was founded by such individuals‑those whose families had been lost yet who were unwilling to continue being caught in endless battles as fiefdom soldiers. They formed their own organization, living among the Jianghu and struggling to make a living. Occasionally, they would rob wealthy merchants traveling on the roads and help impoverished locals."
