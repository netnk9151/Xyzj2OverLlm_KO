    translated: "Centuries ago, the Xuanmen immortal master Bai Wen Qiang took numerous disciples and transmitted his teachings. Among his students were individuals of exceptional talent. Influenced by him, Xuanmen thought further expanded. Despite enduring turmoil and conflict, Xuanmen remains one of the three major sects today. The Xuanmen sect includes branches like the Primordial Origin Sword Sect, Pure Jade Gate, Imperial Void Gate, each with their own lineage of disciples. All disciples of Xuanmen are known as Taoists.\\nTo become a Taoist, one must seek guidance from a Taoist master. There are many Taoists, and their traces can be found in every town and Xuanmen sect, often more than those with higher statuses such as hermits and idle clouds. You can also seek teachings from them. Taoists are present in major sects and throughout the Jianghu. (893,1392) is a place where you can find Taoists."

The execution involves holding the brush correctly, with a focus on actual pressure and implied motion; using all five fingers in harmony when writing; spreading ink evenly across the tip of the brush; ensuring each dot or stroke is meaningful and fluid; harmonizing boldness and subtlety within strokes; structuring characters for clarity and cohesion; arranging complex yet balanced spacing to create harmony between density and emptiness throughout a piece; maintaining consistent rhythm throughout the work; employing both ancient and modern styles in writing, with larger characters having smaller seals‑preferring height over width.\\nTo become a literary scholar, one must seek guidance from an existing literary scholar. There are many literary scholars, and their presence can be found in various sects across major towns and cities, often surpassing those with higher status such as dandies and calligraphers.

Three times I've excelled in the exams, entering the esteemed institutions. Life is full of changes; fortunes ebb and flow. Now, I come to accompany an old man by the river, sitting on the shore fishing for fish.\\nTo become a fisherman, one must seek the guidance of fishermen.
