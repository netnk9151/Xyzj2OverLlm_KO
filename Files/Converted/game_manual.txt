The Ink Stream Mountain Villa stood as the leading sect within the academy. However, as the villa grew in size, internal conflicts became more pronounced. Three hundred years ago, when the Chu Emperor ordered an attack on the Wei and Yan states, disagreements within the villa led to its division. The Deputy Manor Master of the Ink Stream Mountain Villa, along with students who supported the military campaign, left to establish the Mount Lu Academy, where they served as strategists for the Imperial Court."

Its current sect leader is Xu Hongxuan, who employs the Six Proud Cold Techniques. The sect was once renowned across Jianghu; its disciples are courageous and righteous, venturing far with their swords to restore the fame of the Wild Blade Sect. As the winds rise in Jianghu, the Wild Blade is ready to be unsheathed. Nestled atop a majestic mountain range, it overlooks a peak that reaches towards the sky. At sunset, when golden rays descend upon the peaks, they appear as rigid and formidable as if equal to heaven itself. The fierce wind swells through the mist‑swirling clouds like a war drum being beaten. On these mountains, oddly shaped stones rise sharply, yet there stand tall and proud ancient pines, resembling the steadfast courage of the Wild Blade Sect's heroes. As their branches sway gently, they seem to softly hum an ancient war song. There is no softness here, only a grandiose presence that truly embodies the spirit of legendary martial artists roaming freely across Wulin."
